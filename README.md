# Workout Planner

## Live deployment is available [here](https://workout-exercise-planner.herokuapp.com/)

Submission for Code Institute's Data-Centric Development Milestone Project, an application for the planning and logging of workout sessions.

## User Experience

### Target Audience

- People interested in planning their workouts.
- People who want to record their workouts in a list.
- People who want to view or follow others' exercise lists.

### Project Suitability

This project is a suitable way to deliver this content because:

- An authentication feature enables ownership of settings and objects.
- Selective permissions limit user interaction with exercises they are not the owner of, preventing unauthorised editing or removal of others' exercises.
- Users have the ability to create, view, edit or delete their own exercises, and ability to clone others' exercises to their own list.
- Users can "follow" other users, and display followed users' exercises in a filtered list.

## User Stories

1. As a new or established user I want to create a list of exercises for a unique workout day to make a customised one-off workout.
2. As a repeat user wanting to duplicate exercises from a previous workout I want to copy one or multiple exercises from a list.
3. As an established user I want to mark exercises as complete from my workout to-do list as I progress through my workout.
4. As an established user I want to modify an exercise in a list to make corrections or substitutions.
5. As an established user I want to delete exercises from my workout list to dynamically alter a workout at a later stage if the exercise is no longer required.

### User Story Fulfilment

## Design & Styling

### Colour Palette

The initial website design concepts have been formed with the following colour palette:  
![#0f1011](https://placehold.it/15/0f1011/000000?text=+) `#0f1011`  
![#615F5B](https://placehold.it/15/615F5B/000000?text=+) `#615F5B`  
![#A2A29F](https://placehold.it/15/A2A29F/000000?text=+) `#A2A29F`  
![#FBFBFB](https://placehold.it/15/FBFBFB/000000?text=+) `#FBFBFB`  
![#2B5630](https://placehold.it/15/2B5630/000000?text=+) `#2B5630`  
![#04A647](https://placehold.it/15/04A647/000000?text=+) `#04A647`

The chosen palette defines the site as a predominantly dark-themed design with lighter colours used to highlight / segment components.

### Testing

Testing documentation is located in the [testing.md file.](./testing.md)

### Known Bugs & Limitations

Are there any features that don't perform as expected, is the discovery documented through testing section, are potential solutions noted?

## Deployment

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code, and was both committed to git and pushed to GitHub using the integrated source control feature.

The setup for the GitHub Pages deployment was as follows:

- Log into Github.
- Select the target repository from the list.
- Select "Settings" from the menu items.
- Scroll to the Github Pages section.
- Under "Source" click the drop-down that is set to "None" and select "Master Branch".
- The link to the website is now displayed under the "Github Pages" section.

At the time of submission are both the deployed and development versions of this project identical?
