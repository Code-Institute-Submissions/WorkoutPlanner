## User Stories

1. As a new or established user I want to create a list of exercises for a unique workout day to make a customised one-off workout.
2. As a repeat user wanting to duplicate exercises from a previous workout I want to copy one or multiple exercises from a list.
3. As an established user I want to mark exercises as complete from my workout to-do list as I progress through my workout.
4. As an established user I want to modify an exercise in a list to make corrections or substitutions.
5. As an established user I want to delete exercises from my workout list to dynamically alter a workout at a later stage if the exercise is no longer required.

## Technologies Used

* HTML, CSS and Javascript programming languages are used for creating the core structure, styling and logic of this site.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) is primarily used within this project for ease of DOM manipulation.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) is used for resolution responsiveness and for general structuring of the UI.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is used for the version control of this project.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) provides the shuffle and information icons (used for both the welcome trigger and tooltips).
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is used to supply the main font for the majority of this website, the font sourced in this way is ...

## Testing

1. In initial setup stages: Heroku application crashed on startup, initial attempt at fix was removal of reference to non-existent mongoDB environmental variables. Cause of crash determined as non-existent "IP" and "PORT" variables prior to heroku deployment, problem fixed upon their addition. References to mongoDB credentials also reinstated as a result.

2. Submitting of user credentials exposed password as plaintext, as documented in git tag named: "passwordvulnerability". Fixed by use of the werkzeug security module to generate and check password hashes, database now stores passwords in hashed form.

x. Code Validators  

Have [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) validators been used for both HTML and CSS checking?

Has [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) been used by recommendation of The Code Institute to validate the Javascript?

### Known Bugs & Limitations

Are there any features that don't perform as expected, is the discovery documented through testing section, are potential solutions noted?

## Deployment

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code, and was both committed to git and pushed to GitHub using the integrated source control feature.

The setup for the GitHub Pages deployment was as follows:
- Log into Github.
- Select the target repository from the list.
- Select "Settings" from the menu items.
- Scroll to the Github Pages section.
- Under "Source" click the drop-down that is set to "None" and select "Master Branch".
- The link to the website is now displayed under the "Github Pages" section.

At the time of submission are both the deployed and development versions of this project identical?
